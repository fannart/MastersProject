# Master's Project - Pathtracer 

As a project for my masters degree, I researched and created a pathtracer over the summer of 2016.

## Abstract from thesis

The aim of this project was to implement a ray caster, as presented by [Appel](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1468082) with the addition of an interactive component. The implementation was to be built towards a path tracer, as suggested by [Kajiya](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=15902) as a method for solving the rendering equation presented in the same paper. Path tracing is a more evolved method for light transport, allowing for global illumination and more physically accurate shading. The result is a global illumination renderer with lambertian surfaces, requiring additional work for interactivity and addition of reective and transmittive surfaces.

## Development 

The project was developed with Qt in C++ and uses the glm mathematics library.
